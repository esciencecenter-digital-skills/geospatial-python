    "## Dealing with Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have visualized a band of a Sentinel-2 scene and calculated its statistics. However, we need to take missing data into account. Raster data often has a “no data value” associated with it and for raster datasets read in by `rioxarray`. This value is referred to as `nodata`. This is a value assigned to pixels where data is missing or no data were collected. There can be different cases that cause missing data, and it’s common for other values in a raster to represent different cases. The most common example is missing data at the edges of rasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the shape of a raster is always rectangular. So if we have a dataset that has a shape that isn’t rectangular, some pixels at the edge of the raster will have no data values. This often happens when the data were collected by a sensor which only flew over some part of a defined region.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen above, the `nodata` value of this dataset (`raster_ams_b9.rio.nodata`) is 0. When we have plotted the band data, or calculated statistics, the missing value was not distinguished from other values. Missing data may cause some unexpected results. For example, the 25th percentile we just calculated was 0, probably reflecting the presence of a lot of missing data in the raster.\n",
    "\n",

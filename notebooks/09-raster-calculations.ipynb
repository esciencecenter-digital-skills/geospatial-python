    "\n",
    "We often want to combine values of and perform calculations on rasters to create a new output raster. This episode\n",
    "covers how to perform basic math operations using raster datasets. It also illustrates how to match rasters with\n",
    "different resolutions so that they can be used in the same calculation. As an example, we will calculate a vegetation\n",
    "index over one of the satellite scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are interested in monitoring vegetation fluctuations using satellite remote sensors. Scientists have defined\n",
    "a vegetation index to quantify the amount of green leaf vegetation using the light reflected in different wavelengths.\n",
    "This index, named Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), exploits the fact that healthy green leaves strongly\n",
    "absorb red visible light while they mostly reflect light in the near infrared (NIR). The NDVI is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ NDVI = \\frac{NIR - red}{NIR + red} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $NIR$ and $red$ label the reflectance values of the corresponding wavelengths. NDVI values range from -1 to +1.\n",
    "Values close to one indicate high density of green leaves. Poorly vegetated areas typically have NDVI values close to\n",
    "zero. Negative NDVI values often indicate cloud and water bodies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Statistics on predefined zones of the raster data are commonly used for analysis and to better understand the data. These zones are often provided within a single vector dataset, identified by certain vector attributes. For example, in the previous episodes, we used the crop field polygon dataset. The fields with the same crop type can be identified as a “zone”, resulting in multiple zones in one vector dataset. One may be interested in performing statistical analysis over these crop zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode, we will explore how to calculate zonal statistics based on the types of crops in `fields_cropped.shp`. To do this, we will first identify zones from the vector data, then rasterize these vector zones. Finally the zonal statistics for `ndvi` will be calculated over the rasterized zones.\n",

    "First, let’s load the `NDVI.tif` file saved in the previous episode to obtained our calculated raster `ndvi` data. We also use the `squeeze()` function in order to reduce our raster data `ndvi` dimension to 2D by removing the singular `band` dimension - this is necessary for use with the `rasterize` and `zonal_stats` functions:"

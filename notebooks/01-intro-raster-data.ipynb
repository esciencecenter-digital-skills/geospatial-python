    "\n",
    "This episode introduces the two primary types of geospatial\n",
    "data: rasters and vectors. After briefly introducing these\n",
    "data types, this episode focuses on raster data, describing\n",
    "some major features and types of raster data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures: Raster and Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The two primary types of geospatial data are raster\n",
    "and vector data. Raster data is stored as a grid of values which are rendered on a\n",
    "map as pixels. Each pixel value represents an area on the Earth’s surface. Vector data structures represent specific features on the\n",
    "Earth’s surface, and\n",
    "assign attributes to those features. Vector data structures\n",
    "will be discussed in more detail in [the next episode](02-intro-vector-data.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will focus on how to work with both raster and vector\n",
    "data sets, therefore it is essential that we understand the\n",
    "basic structures of these types of data and the types of data\n",
    "that they can be used to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data is any pixelated (or gridded) data where each pixel is associated\n",
    "with a specific geographic location. The value of a pixel can be\n",
    "continuous (e.g. elevation) or categorical (e.g. land use). If this sounds\n",
    "familiar, it is because this data structure is very common: it’s how\n",
    "we represent any digital image. A geospatial raster is only different\n",
    "from a digital photo in that it is accompanied by spatial information\n",
    "that connects the data to a particular location. This includes the\n",
    "raster’s extent and cell size, the number of rows and columns, and\n",
    "its coordinate reference system (or CRS).\n",

    "class such as a landcover type (e.g., “forest” or “grassland”) rather than a\n",
    "continuous value such as elevation or temperature. Some examples of classified\n",

    "add any points that weren’t brought up in the small group\n",
    "discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data has some important advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   representation of continuous surfaces\n",
    "-   potentially very high levels of detail\n",
    "-   data is ‘unweighted’ across its extent - the geometry doesn’t\n",
    "    implicitly highlight features\n",
    "-   cell-by-cell calculations can be very fast and efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The downsides of raster data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   very large file sizes as cell size gets smaller\n",
    "-   currently popular formats don’t embed metadata well (more on this later!)\n",
    "-   can be difficult to represent complex information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Attributes of Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extent\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial extent is the geographic area that the raster data covers.\n",
    "The spatial extent of an object represents the geographic edge or\n",
    "location that is the furthest north, south, east and west. In other words, extent\n",
    "represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"attachment:fig/E01/spatial_extent.png\" alt=\"spatial extent objects\" />\n",
    "<figcaption>Spatial extent image (Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON))</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extent Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, the dashed boxes around each set of objects\n",
    "seems to imply that the three objects have the same extent. Is this\n",
    "accurate? If not, which object(s) have a different extent?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines and polygon objects have the same extent. The extent for\n",
    "the points object is smaller in the vertical direction than the\n",
    "other two because there are no points on the line at y = 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "A resolution of a raster represents the area on the ground that each\n",
    "pixel of the raster covers. The image below illustrates the effect\n",
    "of changes in resolution.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Raster Data Format for this Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data can come in many different formats. For this workshop, we will use\n",
    "the GeoTIFF format which has the extension `.tif`. A `.tif` file stores metadata\n",
    "or attributes about the file as embedded `tif tags`. For instance, your camera\n",
    "might store a tag that describes the make and model of the camera or the date\n",
    "the photo was taken when it saves a `.tif`. A GeoTIFF is a standard `.tif` image\n",
    "format with additional spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the file\n",
    "as tags. These tags should include the following raster metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Extent\n",
    "2.  Resolution\n",
    "3.  Coordinate Reference System (CRS) - we will introduce this concept in [a later episode](03-crs.md)\n",
    "4.  Values that represent missing data (`NoDataValue`) - we will introduce this\n",
    "    concept in [a later episode](06-raster-intro.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss these attributes in more detail in [a later episode](06-raster-intro.md).\n",
    "In that episode, we will also learn how to use Python to extract raster attributes\n",
    "from a GeoTIFF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More Resources on the `.tif` format\n",
    "\n",

    "### Multi-band Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A raster can contain one or more bands. One type of multi-band raster\n",
    "dataset that is familiar to many of us is a color\n",
    "image. A basic color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue.\n",
    "Each\n",
    "band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of\n",
    "the\n",
    "electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when\n",
    "composited\n",
    "creates the colors that we see in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "<figcaption>RGB multi-band raster image (Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).)</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plot each band of a multi-band image individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we can composite all three bands together to make a color image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multi-band dataset, the rasters will always have the same extent,\n",
    "resolution, and CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Types of Multi-band Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-band raster data might also contain:\n",
    "1. **Time series:** the same variable, over the same area, over time.\n",
    "2. **Multi or hyperspectral imagery:** image rasters that have 4 or\n",
    "more (multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands. We\n",
    "won’t be working with this type of data in this workshop, but you can\n",
    "check out the NEON Data Skills [Imaging Spectroscopy HDF5 in R](https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r)\n",
    "tutorial if you’re interested in working with hyperspectral data cubes.\n",

    "-   Raster data is pixelated data where each pixel is associated with a specific location.\n",
    "-   Raster data always has an extent and a resolution.\n",
    "-   The extent is the geographical area covered by a raster.\n",
    "-   The resolution is the area covered by each pixel of a raster."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of satellites take snapshots of the Earth’s surface from space. The images recorded by these remote sensors\n",
    "represent a very precious data source for any activity that involves monitoring changes on Earth. Satellite imagery is\n",
    "typically provided in the form of geospatial raster data, with the measurements in each grid cell (“pixel”) being\n",
    "associated to accurate geographic coordinate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode we will explore how to access open satellite data using Python. In particular, we will\n",
    "consider [the Sentinel-2 data collection that is hosted on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs).\n",
    "This dataset consists of multi-band optical images acquired by the two satellites of\n",
    "[the Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) and it is continuously updated with\n",
    "new images.\n",

    "### The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Current sensor resolutions and satellite revisit periods are such that terabytes of data products are added daily to the\n",
    "corresponding collections. Such datasets cannot be made accessible to users via full-catalog download. Space agencies\n",
    "and other data providers often offer access to their data catalogs through interactive Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs),\n",
    "see for instance the [Copernicus Open Access Hub portal](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) for the Sentinel\n",
    "missions. Accessing data via a GUI is a nice way to explore a catalog and get familiar with its content, but it\n",
    "represents a heavy and error-prone task that should be avoided if carried out systematically to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A service that offers programmatic access to the data enables users to reach the desired data in a more reliable,\n",
    "scalable and reproducible manner. An important element in the software interface exposed to the users, which is generally called\n",
    "the Application Programming Interface (API), is the use of standards. Standards, in fact, can significantly facilitate\n",
    "the reusability of tools and scripts across datasets and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification is an emerging standard for describing geospatial data. By\n",
    "organizing metadata in a form that adheres to the STAC specifications, data providers make it possible for users to\n",
    "access data from different missions, instruments and collections using the same set of tools.\n",

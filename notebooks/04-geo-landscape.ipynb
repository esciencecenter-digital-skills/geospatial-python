    "## GUI vs CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest computer systems operated without a graphical user interface (GUI),\n",
    "relying only on the command-line interface (CLI). Since mapping and spatial analysis\n",
    "are strongly visual tasks, GIS applications benefited greatly from the emergence of\n",
    "GUIs and quickly came to rely heavily on them. Most modern GIS applications have very\n",
    "complex GUIs, with all common tools and procedures accessed via buttons and menus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of using a GUI include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Tools are all laid out in front of you\n",
    "-   Complex commands are easy to build\n",
    "-   Don’t need to learn a coding language\n",
    "-   Cartography and visualisation is more intuitive and flexible\n",
    "\n",
    "Downsides of using a GUI include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Low reproducibility - you can’t record your actions and replay\n",
    "-   Most are not designed for batch-processing files\n",
    "-   Limited ability to customise functions or write your own\n",
    "-   Intimidating interface for new users - so many buttons!\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific computing, the lack of reproducibility in point-and-click software has\n",
    "come to be viewed as a critical weakness. As such, scripted CLI-style workflows are\n",
    "again becoming popular, which leads us to another approach to doing GIS — via a\n",
    "programming language. This is the approach we will be using throughout this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GIS in programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of powerful geospatial processing libraries exist for general-purpose\n",
    "programming languages like Java and C++. However, the learning curve for these\n",
    "languages is steep and the effort required is excessive for users who only need a\n",
    "subset of their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-level scripting languages like Python and R are easier to learn and use. Both\n",
    "now have their own packages that wrap up those geospatial processing libraries and make\n",
    "them easy to access and use safely. A key example is the Java Topology Suite (JTS),\n",
    "which is implemented in C++ as GEOS. GEOS is accessible in Python via the `shapely`\n",
    "package (and `geopandas`, which makes use of `shapely`) and in R via `sf`. R and Python\n",
    "also have interface packages for GDAL, and for specific GIS apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last point is a huge advantage for GIS-by-programming; these interface packages\n",
    "give you the ability to access functions unique to particular programs, but have your\n",
    "entire workflow recorded in a central document - a document that can be re-run at will.\n",
    "Below are lists of some of the key spatial packages for Python, which we will be using in the\n",
    "remainder of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `geopandas` and `geocube` for working with vector data\n",
    "-   `rasterio` and `rioxarray` for working with raster data\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages along with the `matplotlib` package are all we need for spatial data visualisation. Python also has many fundamental scientific packages that are relevant in the geospatial domain. Below is a list of particularly fundamental packages. `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-image` are all excellent options for working with rasters, as arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of these and other Python spatial packages can be [accessed here](https://medium.com/@chrieke/essential-geospatial-python-libraries-5d82fcc38731).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a programming language, Python can be a CLI tool. However, using\n",
    "Python together with an [Integrated Development Environment](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide) (IDE) application\n",
    "allows some GUI features to become part of your workflow. IDEs allow the best of both\n",
    "worlds. They provide a place to visually examine data and other software objects,\n",
    "interact with your file system, and draw plots and maps, but your activities are still\n",
    "command-driven: recordable and reproducible. There are several IDEs available for Python.\n",
    "[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) is well-developed and the most widely used option for data science\n",
    "in Python. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)\n",
    "are other popular options for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional GIS apps are also moving back towards providing a scripting environment for\n",
    "users, further blurring the CLI/GUI divide. ESRI have adopted Python into their\n",
    "software, and QGIS is both Python and R-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GIS File Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of file types that are used in GIS analysis. Depending on the program you choose to use some file\n",
    "types can be used while others are not readable. Below is a brief table describing some of the most common vector and\n",
